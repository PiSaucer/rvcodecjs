# rvcodec.js

[![pages-build-deployment](https://github.com/PiSaucer/rvcodecjs/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/PiSaucer/rvcodecjs/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment)

## Introduction

**rvcodec.js** is a RISC-V instruction encoder/decoder available at
<https://luplab.gitlab.io/rvcodecjs/> and <https://pisaucer.github.io/rvcodecjs/web-ui/>.

**rvcodec.js** conveniently shows how each token of the assembly instruction is
encoded as part of the binary representation.

## Contributing

### Run locally

- Clone this repo: `$ git clone https://github.com/PiSaucer/rvcodecjs.git`
- Install dependencies: `$ npm install`
- Make changes
    * The encoding/decoding logic is in directory `core`
    * The web user interface is in directory `web-ui`
- Run testsuite to avoid any regressions: `$ npm test`
- Open website locally to test UI: `$ npm run open`

### Roadmap

If you'd like to contribute, here are the main features we'd like to add:

- [x] Support for RV32I instruction set
- [x] Support for RV64I instruction set
- [x] Support for RV128I instruction set
- [x] Support for rest of GC extensions
    - [x] Zifencei instruction set
    - [x] Zicsr instruction set
    - [x] M (multiplication/division) instruction set
    - [x] A (atomic) instruction set
    - [x] F (single-precision floating point) instruction set
    - [x] D (double-precision floating point) instruction set
    - [x] Q (quad-precision floating point) instruction set
    - [x] C (compressed) instruction set
